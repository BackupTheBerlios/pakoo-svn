List of TODO items for the Pakoo package manager frontend.

Immediate:
- Refactor libpakt:
  * PortageBackend::settings as static variable?
- Other refactoring issues:
  * PackageInfoView -> InfoView, and dynamic HTMLGenerator switching
  * Make PortagePackageHTMLGenerator work again
  * Portage versions of the widgets


Reasons for switching libpakt to kdelibs:
- Translations
- K(Ext)Process
- KShared
- Consistent build system
- Widgets?

Really Serious Bugs (TM):
- none at this moment

Not so serious bugs:
- Skips package descriptions when scrolling down fast
- Doesn't obey package.mask

Visible enhancements:
- Version links in the info view should select version items.
- Status bar enhancements (progressbar while loading the tree).

Code enhancements:
- iterator -> const_iterator

UI Design:
- Search folders in the tree view, together with the categories
  ("Refine Search" button instead of quick filter area)
- Package Info folder in the tree view, which opens a detailed package info view
  where the package list normally resides.
- "Actions" tab: install, uninstall, revdep-rebuild, etc.
- "Configure" tab: view/edit configuration files
- How to handle very detailed package info (like use flags or dependencies)?
  * Show in the info view? (One tab for use flags and one for dependencies?) (Don't fit 800x600)
  * Or hide the package list. (Fit 800x600)
- Provide two (un)installing possibilities (immediate/queued):
  * "(Un)Install Selected" makes a queue containing one package and executes it
  * "Add To Queue" adds the item to the install/uninstall queue
- Provide a list of packages depending on a package queued for uninstall?

Feature set:
- merging
  * refresh (emerge sync)
  * install (emerge)
  * uninstall (emerge -C)
  * clean up (emerge depclean)
  * etc-update or dispatch-conf
  * revdep-rebuild
- searching
- configuring
- Add support for reading /var/cache/edb/dep in CDB format.
