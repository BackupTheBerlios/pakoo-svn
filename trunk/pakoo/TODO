List of TODO items for the Pakoo package manager frontend.

Immediate tasks:
- Let the user stop package scanning, and/or make an option of it.

Really Serious Bugs (TM):
- Killed when scrolling down packages that have not yet been loaded.

Not so serious bugs:
- Fix search line when switching categories.

Visible enhancements:
- Version links in the info view should select version items.
- "Updatable" or "Packages in world" filter?
- Status bar enhancements (progressbar while loading the tree).

Code enhancements:
- A consistent interface for passing the Settings object
- Namespaces?

UI Design:
- Search folders in the tree view, together with the categories
  ("Refine Search" button instead of quick filter area)
- "Vertical tab" widget (as in KDevelop's documentation sidebar), don't know what it's called
- Other tab categories: "Actions" (like install, uninstall, revdep-rebuild, etc.)
- How to handle "late loading" package info (description, updatable) in the quick search?
- How to select packages for installing/deinstalling/etc?
- Install queue or instant "one emerge per thread" processing?

Big features:

  * refresh (emerge sync)
