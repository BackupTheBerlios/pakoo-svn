Pakoo Todo.

Immediate (for a 0.1 release, or such):
- Proper output in the info view.
- Let the user stop package scanning, and/or make an option of it.
- Load cascading profiles to retrieve arch, portage dirs, system packages and other things.
- Namespaces?
- properly process _beta (& Co.) without number

Later:
- Fix search line when switching categories.
- "Updatable" or "Packages in world" filter?
- Status bar enhancements (progressbar for tree loading).
- Support for profiles.
- Support for multiple overlay dirs (like "/usr/portage /usr/local/portage").

And many other things that haven't yet been written down.
