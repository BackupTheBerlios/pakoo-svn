List of TODO items for the Pakoo package manager frontend.

Really Serious Bugs (TM):
- Killed when scrolling down packages that have not yet been loaded.
  Probably caused by heavy threading, although I don't know what could be wrong.
  Solution: Create a scheduler for package scanning which obsoletes using multiple PackageScanners.

Not so serious bugs:
- Fix search line when switching categories.

Visible enhancements:
- Version links in the info view should select version items.
- "Updatable" or "Packages in world" filter (how to do that with delayed loading?)
- Status bar enhancements (progressbar while loading the tree).

Code enhancements:
- create an AllInOneLoader:
  * front end for specific loading stuff like TreeScanner, PackageScanner and ProfileLoader
  * feature-based loading ("provide names for all packages", "provide description for package xyz")
  * makes it easier to abstract out loading activities
- a consistent interface for passing the Settings object
- renames:
  * PortageTreeView -> TreeView
  * PackageInfoView -> InfoView
  * consistent use of "Portage" prefixes
- use namespaces
- abstract out important classes and make a plugin-like interface
  (which would be the first step to the possibility of using multiple backends)

UI Design:
- Search folders in the tree view, together with the categories
  ("Refine Search" button instead of quick filter area)
- "Actions" tab: install, uninstall, revdep-rebuild, etc.
- "Configure" tab: view/edit configuration files
- How to handle very detailed package info (like use flags or dependencies)?
- How to handle "late loading" package info (description, updatable) in the quick search?
- Provide two (un)installing possibilites (immediate/queued):
  * "(Un)Install Selected" makes a queue containing one package and executes it
  * "Add To Queue" adds the item to the install/uninstall queue

Feature set:
- merging
  * refresh (emerge sync)
  * install (emerge)
  * uninstall (emerge -C)
  * clean up (emerge depclean)
  * etc-update
  * revdep-rebuild
- searching
- configuring
