* done the remaining refactoring work at PackageVersion/Package,
  now we're essentially set for moving on more quickly
  - new files:
    > core: portagepackage.[h|cpp], portagepackageversion.[h|cpp],
            packagequeue.[h|cpp]
* PortageHTMLGenerator is disabled for now, I rather refactor this
  as well (which is the last task in refactoring) instead of just
  making it compile again.
* fixed a ProcessJob related crash when shutting down

2005-08-31 Jakob Petsovits <jpetso@gmx.at>
* Introducing libpakt's process management
  - new files:

    > installer: emergeprocess.[h|cpp]
* Code maintaining
  - Make member variables start with "m_"
  - Iron out emitDebugOutput() calls
  - removed files:
    > core: iasyncjob.h (merged with IJob into ijob.h again)

* the big libqortage (now libpakt) refactoring (man, this was tough!):
  - make a "setBlaBla(bla); start();" interface instead of "startBla(bla);"
  - drop the nasty event handling in favour of jobs with signals (mmmh)
  - Safer Threading(TM)
  - Qt'ify the API in general
  - a big leap into backend independence
  - a quadrizillion other changes, only a few of them in functionality
  - and, of course, port the front end to the new API
  - new files:
    > libpakt: backendfactory.[h|cpp], portagebackend.[h|cpp]
    > core:    ijob.h, iasyncjob.h, threadedjob.[h|cpp],
               packagecategory.[h|cpp], portagecategory.[h|cpp],
               packageselector.[h|cpp], fileloaderbase.[h|cpp]
    > loader:  packageloader.[h|cpp], multiplepackageloader.[h|cpp],
               initialloader.[h|cpp], portageinitialloader.[h|cpp]
  - removed files:
    > loader:  loadingevent.[h|cpp], portageloaderbase.[h|cpp]
  - renamed files:
    > core:    portagetree.[h|cpp] -> packagelist.[h|cpp]
    > loader:  packagescanner.[h|cpp] -> portagepackageloader.[h|cpp]
    > widgets: portagetreeview.[h|cpp] -> packagetreeview.[h|cpp]
